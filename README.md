# Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

## Code: Contains the Verilog or VHDL code for the DSP48A1 blocks.

1- DSP48A1_D_BLOCK: Main DSP48A1 module implementation.
2- DSP48A1: Additional modules and sub-modules for DSP48A1.
3- Test Bench: Test benches used to validate the DSP48A1 block functionality.

## Simulation: Includes simulation scripts and configurations.

1- Do file: Contains the commands to run the simulations.
2- Constrain: Constraint files used during synthesis.

## Monitor: Details on how to monitor the simulation results.

## Schematic: Contains elaboration, synthesis, and implementation schematics.
1- RTL message: Register Transfer Level schematic and messages.
2- Synthesis message: Messages and warnings from the synthesis process.
3- Implementation message: Messages and warnings from the implementation process.
